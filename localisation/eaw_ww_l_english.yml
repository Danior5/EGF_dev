 ww.news.1.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Confusing and shocking reports are coming in from the edges of the Everfree Forest. It seems that Sunset Shimmer - the late star pupil of Princess Celestia who mysteriously disappeared several years ago - has just come back. However she is not alone! The pathways of the Everfree are filled with hundreds, if not thousands of vechicles: tanks, trucks, motorcycles and much, much more.\nWhat's even more confusing however is the ponies operating this equipment. They are all very young and seem to be struggling with even basic body movements - they say they prefer walking only on their back hooves!\nNevertheless Sunset is claiming that this new army will deliever a crushing counterattack and win the war for Equestria."
