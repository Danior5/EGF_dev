 ww.news.1.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Confusing and shocking reports are coming in from the edges of the Everfree Forest. It seems that Sunset Shimmer - the late star pupil of Princess Celestia who mysteriously disappeared several years ago - has just come back. However she is not alone! The pathways of the Everfree are filled with hundreds, if not thousands of vechicles: tanks, trucks, motorcycles and much, much more.\nWhat's even more confusing however is the ponies operating this equipment. They are all very young and seem to be struggling with even basic body movements - they say they prefer walking only on their back hooves!\nNevertheless Sunset is claiming that this new army will deliever a crushing counterattack and win the war for Equestria."

UPA forces initially rejoiced as they reclaimed the small border town of Fairflanks, however everything changed when they discovered what had happened there during the Changeling occupation. The basement of the city's hospital had been home to horrific medical experiments on Equestrian prisoners of war. Recovered documents suggest these acts of sheer barbarity were done to help advance the development of Changeling chemical weapons.\nThe discovery brought worldwide condemnation from all members of the River Coalition alliance as well as a pledge to find and punish those responsible."
